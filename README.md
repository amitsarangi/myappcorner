# MyAppCorner

MyAppCorner is a novel interface for interacting with public multi-touch displays. The system aims to provide a personal space for the users and give them a sense of ownership. It allows users to create their own private window and drag and drop available applications from the menu into their window. The menu can also be dragged to different parts of the screen, hence making it easily accessible for all users.

Published Paper : Marc Belles Fabregat, Fernando David Marin Leyva, Joy Saina, and Amit Sarangi. 2016. Demonstration of MyAppCorner: creating personal interaction areas on a public screen. In Proceedings of the 20th International Academic Mindtrek Conference (AcademicMindtrek '16). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 445-448. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2994310.2994343

In this paper, we present the design, development, testing and evaluation on MyAppCorner interface. The interface was integrated in a 72" and 62" multi-touch screens to give the actual feel of a public display. The system was then tested to help us discover its drawbacks and see if it supports multiple users and whether it meets public space needs.

P.S. Tested only on windows system
P.P.S - This is build with an obsolete multitouch framework called MT4J- (Archived Home Page)[http://web.archive.org/web/20130925153019/http://www.mt4j.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page]. It's a great framework as a starter to multitouch. So I have included all the examples in case someone wants to learn.
